## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **xevion1** — a hacker in spirit, a programmer by craft.  
I mix **code + art + story** into neon-colored projects that feel alive.  

This repo is home to my **Hacker & Programming Series**, where I share:  
- ⚡ **Decorative hacker HTML templates**  
- ⚡ **Neon terminal banners**  
- ⚡ **Story-driven programming guides**  
- ⚡ **Glitch-style visuals & matrix animations**

## 🕶️ My Hacks

My “hacks” aren’t about destruction — they’re about **creation, discovery, and bending systems to my will**.  
Here are some of the hacks I’ve built or experimented with:

🔹 **Terminal Hacks** — Custom banners, fish-shell setups, glowing ASCII art intros.  
🔹 **Visual Hacks** — Matrix-style backgrounds, neon-glow animations, and glitch typography.  
🔹 **App Hacks** — Turning simple HTML/CSS into APK apps with free tools.  
🔹 **Story Hacks** — Mixing narrative with code, inspired by cyberpunk and Mr. Robot.  
🔹 **Learning Hacks** — Making programming look and feel *exciting*, not boring.  

Every “hack” is a way of **remixing technology** — taking something ordinary and making it extraordinary.

## 🌌 My Origin Story

Like Mr. Robot, I saw how fragile systems are.  
But unlike his chaos, I chose **creativity over destruction**.  

- 💻 I started with small scripts that bent the terminal to my personality.  
- 🎨 I made HTML templates glow like neon nights.  
- 📱 I learned how to wrap code into mobile apps and share them.  
- 🔐 I explored security concepts to understand *why* systems break — and how to protect them.  

I am not Elliot. I am not fsociety.  
I am **xevion1** — and this is my own rebellion:  
A rebellion of **style, curiosity, and endless creation**.

## ⚖️ Ethical Note

The word *hacker* here is about:  
🔹 **Curiosity** — finding out how things work.  
🔹 **Creativity** — bending systems into art.  
🔹 **Defense** — learning to secure what others ignore.  

This project is **educational + creative** only.  
No illegal activity — only inspiration and learning.
